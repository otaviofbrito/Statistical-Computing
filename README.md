# Statistical Computing with R

## Introduction

This repository provides a set of R scripts for performing different statistical computations. 

## Installation

To use these scripts, you need to have R installed on your system. You can download and install R from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/).

Additionally, you might need some R packages depending on the specific script. You can install these packages using the following command in your R console:

```R
install.packages("RcmdrMisc")
library(RcmdrMisc)
```

## Usage

Each R script in this repository can be run independently. To use a script, simply clone this repository and run the desired script using R. For example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/otaviofbrito/Statistical-Computing.git
Rscript script_name.R
```


## Algorithms

Below is a list of the available algorithms in this repository, along with a brief description of each:

- **sampling.R**: Implements various sampling techniques, including simple random sampling and stratified sampling.
- **histogram.R**: Generates histograms for visualizing the distribution of a dataset.
- **confidence_interval.R**: Calculates confidence intervals for population parameters.
- **two_population_test.R**: Performs statistical tests comparing two populations.
- **hypothesis_test.R**: Conducts hypothesis testing for various statistical hypotheses.

Each script contains detailed comments and documentation within the code to explain the steps and logic used.
